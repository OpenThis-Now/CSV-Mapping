# Logo Instructions

## Adding Your Mapping Bridge Logo

1. **Save your logo image** as `mapping-bridge-logo.png`
2. **Place it in this folder**: `frontend/public/images/`
3. **Recommended specifications**:
   - Format: PNG (with transparency if needed)
   - Size: Approximately 200x60 pixels or similar ratio
   - Background: Transparent or white
   - File size: Under 50KB for fast loading

## Alternative formats supported:
- `mapping-bridge-logo.jpg` (if you prefer JPG)
- `mapping-bridge-logo.svg` (if you have SVG version)

## Fallback:
If the image fails to load, the system will automatically show "Mapping Bridge" text instead.

## Current setup:
The logo will be displayed at 32px height (h-8) and will scale proportionally.
